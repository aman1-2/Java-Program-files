/* This is our first prpgram Printing the iconic hello world program.*/
public class helloWorld{
    public static void main(String args[]){
        System.out.print("Hello World -> by using print function."); //Stats the next line printing exact from the world where it ends

        System.out.println("Aman Pratap Singh -> by using println function."); //Starts the next line printing from the new fresh line.

        System.out.printf("Aman Pratap Singh -> by using printf function"); //A function similar to what we use in the our c-programming language to print the output.

/* So the first two lines of the program can be taken as boiler-plate code as these are the
must to write in our programs..
public class <file_name>{
    public static void main(String args[]){

    }
}  we have our outer class name as file name because the java complier searches for the class
name as its file name therfore it is preffred to have the outer class name similar to the file
name...
And the execution of the program starts from the main function that's why in the next line we
have a main fucntion...
